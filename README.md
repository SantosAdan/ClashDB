# ClashDB

It's kind of a cyclopedia of Clash Royale. It's basically an Ionic getting started tutorial using HttpModule and simple concepts of Ionic Framework.

It pretty much need improvement but I lack the free hours to do so.

## What it has

It has four tabs:

1.Cards
1.Arenas
1.Chests
1.Related Videos (Youtube API)

## Credits

It was made possible by using Clash Royale API which can be found at [martincarrera/clash-royale-api](https://github.com/martincarrera/clash-royale-api).
